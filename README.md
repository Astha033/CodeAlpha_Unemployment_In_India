# CodeAlpha_Unemployment_In_India

Unemployment Analysis with Python.ipynb provides an analysis of unemployment rates before and during a specified event, possibly the COVID-19 lockdown. It leverages Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to visualize and compare unemployment trends across different states.

Key Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The notebook loads data on unemployment rates from relevant datasets, cleans the data, and performs any necessary preprocessing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes visualizations such as bar plots, swarm plots, and/or strip plots to explore the distribution of unemployment rates across different states before and during a specified period (likely the COVID-19 lockdown).
State-wise Comparison: The analysis highlights differences in estimated unemployment rates between states, focusing on two distinct periods: before and during lockdown.
Visualization Techniques:
Swarm plots to show individual data points while minimizing overlap.
Strip plots for alternative visual representation with reduced marker size.
Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries installed:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
seaborn: For generating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
numpy: For numerical operations (if used for calculations).

Visualizations
The notebook provides insightful visualizations, such as:

State-wise Unemployment Rate Comparison: Before and during the lockdown, represented using swarm or strip plots.
Distribution Plots: To examine the spread and concentration of unemployment rates across states.
